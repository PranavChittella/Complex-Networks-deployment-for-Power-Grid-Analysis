# Complex-Networks-deployment-for-Power-Grid-Analysis
This project is about trying to find the nodes which are highly connected and then experiment on the effects the removal of such nodes might have and then testing different strategies to find another major node to power the blacked out region without overloading any nodes which might lead to cascading failures. 
The report for the project is clearly written in Network_Science_Report.pdf
The code and data are seperately located in two different folders, and every algorithm used in the project is having different executable Python script (.py)
The Gephi visualisations are also attached.
